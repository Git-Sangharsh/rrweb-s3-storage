# The project is at the time of writing deployed to GitHub pages for simplicity.
# It doesn't require any dependencies so we simply run pnpm build and upload the 
# dist folder to GitHub pages, using the new upload-pages-artifact action.
# The upload action is configured to run on push to main branch only, but the
# rest of the workflow is triggered on any PR to main branch. We only build on
# changes to ./frontend/
